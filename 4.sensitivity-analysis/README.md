##different options

In option tradings, there is a difference between out-of-the-money and in-the-money options.


* Call options. Recall that call options are investments chosen by people who think the underlying stock will continue to rise. In-the-money call options are options where the strike price is lower than the current stock price.

e.g. call option with strike price €50. If stock is valued at €51 it is in-the-money, because the stock has already exceeded the strike price. If the strike price would be above €51, the call option would be considered out-of-the-money.

*Put options. With put options, investors believe the stock price will go down. In-the-money put options have strike prices above the current stock price, e.g. €12 stock with a €14 strike price. Put options with a strike price of €10 in this example are out-of-the-money.
